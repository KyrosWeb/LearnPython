# Python Classes

# Without classes, we would have to define separate variables and methods for each object
# For example, if we want to create two cars, we would have to do something like this:

car1_name = "Car1"
car1_color = "Red"
def car1_start():
    print(f"{car1_name} is starting.")

car2_name = "Car2"
car2_color = "Blue"
def car2_start():
    print(f"{car2_name} is starting.")

car1_start()
car2_start()

# With classes, we can define a blueprint for a car and then create as many cars as we want
# Here's a class that defines a car:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is starting.")

# Now we can use this class to create any car:

car1 = Car("Car1", "Red")
car2 = Car("Car2", "Blue")

car1.start()
car2.start()
